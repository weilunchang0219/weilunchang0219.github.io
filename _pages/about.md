I am a junior year student at National Tsing Hua University, majoring in Power Mechanical Engineering (PME). I am passionate about robotics and have a strong interest in hardware development. I have experience in PCB layout design and mechanical design, and I am also an expert in the field of 3D printing.

Currently, I am working on a competition related to the EUROBOT 2025 robotics challenge and focusing on a humanoid robot for my Capstone Project. I am eager to learn and grow in the field of robotics and excited about the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects.

I have a superpower, I learn new things fast, I have strong motivation to learn, for example, I learned how to design PCB schematic & Layout in only about 2 months.

我擁有一項超能力：我能夠迅速掌握新知識，並擁有強烈的學習動機。舉例來說，我僅用了約兩個月的時間就學會了PCB原理圖與佈局設計。
