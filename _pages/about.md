I am a junior year student at National Tsing Hua University, majoring in Power Mechanical Engineering (PME). I am passionate about robotics and have a strong interest in hardware development. I have experience in PCB layout design and mechanical design, and I am also an expert in the field of 3D printing.

Currently, I am working on a competition related to the EUROBOT 2025 robotics challenge and focusing on a humanoid robot for my Capstone Project. I am eager to learn and grow in the field of robotics and excited about the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects.
